# Python Quiz Game (Template)

A console-based multiple-choice quiz game. I designed this project to be a **reusable template**, meaning the game logic is separated from the data.

**Note:** The user interface is in Hungarian.

## Features
* **Flexible Template:** The code is designed so you can easily swap out the questions and answers to create a quiz about *any* topic (History, Science, IT, etc.) without changing the logic.
* **Input Validation:** The game protects against invalid inputs (ensures the user types A, B, or C).
* **Score Calculation:** Automatically calculates the success percentage at the end.

## How to Customize
To create your own quiz, simply edit the `questions`, `options`, and `answers` variables in the `quiz_game.py` file.

## How to Run
```bash
python quiz_game.py
